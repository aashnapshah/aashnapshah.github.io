I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at Harvard University, where I work on **AI for Equity and Fairness in Clinical Care**. My research focuses on developing machine learning systems that can improve healthcare outcomes while ensuring fairness and reducing bias across different demographic groups.

My work spans the intersection of:
- **Machine Learning and AI**
- **Healthcare Informatics** 
- **Fairness and Bias in AI**
- **Clinical Decision Support Systems**

I'm passionate about creating AI systems that not only perform well technically but also serve diverse populations equitably. My research aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technology and real-world healthcare applications, with a particular focus on ensuring that these systems work fairly for all patients regardless of their background.

When I'm not coding or researching, you can find me exploring Boston and New York, reading about the latest developments in AI ethics, or thinking about how to make technology more inclusive and beneficial for everyone.
