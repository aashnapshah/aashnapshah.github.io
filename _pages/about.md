I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, co-advised by [Dr. Arjun (Raj) Manrai](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/people/arjun-raj-manrai) and [Dr. Chirag Patel](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/people/chirag-patel). Broadly, my research lies at the intersection of machine learning, human biology, and clinical decision-making.

I focus on answering a deceptively simple question: **What does it mean to be *"normal"* in medicine - and how do those definitions shape clinical decisions?** Leveraging large-scale electronic health record data such as NHANES, UK Biobank, and Clalit Health Services, I unpack the assumptions and limitations embedded in current definitions of "normal" across domains such as pulmonology, hematology, and radiology. Using methods ranging from statistical learning to generative modeling, I aim to develop more precise, data-driven definitions that better reflect the diversity and heterogeneity of patients in the era of precision medicine.

I'm graduating *this year* and will be on the job market! I'm passionate about continuing to build machine learning models for healthcare and would love to chat about opportunities in both industry and academia. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
